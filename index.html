        <p><em><strong>Italian cuisine</strong></em> has influenced food culture around the world and is viewed as a form of art by many. <strong>Wine, cheese </strong>and <strong>pasta</strong> are important part of <em>Italian meals</em>. Pasta comes in a wide range of shapes, widths and lengths, including <strong>penne, spaghetti, linguine, fusilli</strong> and<strong> lasagna. </strong>

For Italians, food isn't just nourishment, it is life. "Family gatherings are frequent and often centered around food and the extended <em><strong>networks of families</strong></em>," said Wagner.

No one area of Italy eats the same things as the next. Each region has its own spin on <strong>"Italian food,"</strong> according to CNN. For example, most of the foods that Americans view as Italian, such as <strong>spaghetti and pizza</strong>, come from <em><strong>central Italy</strong>,</em>. In the <em><strong>North of Italy</strong></em><strong>, fish, potatoes, rice, sausages, pork and different types of cheeses</strong> are the most common ingredients. Pasta dishes with tomatoes are popular, as are many kinds of stuffed pasta, polenta and risotto. In the <em><strong>South</strong></em>, dishes are dominated by <strong>tomatoes</strong>, either served fresh or cooked into sauce, and also includes <strong>capers, peppers, olives and olive oil, garlic, artichokes, eggplant and ricotta cheese.</strong></p>
